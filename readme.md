## Problem Statement
The competition tasked us with analyzing the impact of rising prices on Kroger and national brands, and to provide strategic recommendations to enhance brand and category performance.

Key questions we addressed:
- How have customer behaviors changed in response to inflation?
- Which categories were most impacted?
- How should Kroger balance the strategies of Kroger and national brands to meet household needs?

For a detailed problem statement, see [Business Question](docs/Business%20Question.docx).

## Data
We worked with a rich dataset provided by 84.51°, focusing on various product categories such as Dairy, Bakery, Meat & Seafood, and more. The data was analyzed to identify key trends and consumer behavior shifts.

Key Data Files:
- [Bakery Household Switch Data](data/Bakery_HH_Switch.csv)
- Additional datasets provided upon request.

## Analysis
Our analysis was structured around understanding the symbiotic relationship between Kroger and national brands, and how this relationship can be leveraged to enhance customer value during periods of inflation.

Key Findings:
- **Customer Behavior Shifts**: Notable shifts in loyalty, convenience, and price sensitivity.
- **Symbiotic Relationship**: National brands attract new customers, while Kroger brands help differentiate and retain them.

For a comprehensive analysis, see our [Product Sampling Analysis Report](research/product_sampling_analysis.docx).

## Strategy and Recommendations
Our proposed strategy revolved around a promotional mix that includes product sampling, targeted promotions, and customer feedback loops to foster loyalty and increase profitability.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Sample**: Introduce product sampling for a positive first impression.
2. **Promote**: Run targeted promotions on sampled items.
3. **Reward**: Implement a feedback reward system to encourage customer loyalty.
